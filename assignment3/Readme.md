# Assignment 3

### Decision Trees

Trained a random forest classifier using the sk-learn implementation. Experimented with a few different hyperparameters of the model. Performed grid search over a range of parameter values to obtain optimal ones. Evaluated using the training accuracy, validation accuracy as well as out of box accuracy. Finally performed a sensitivity analysis of the different hyperparameters and analysed how the model performance changes as these hyperparameters are changed.

### Neural Networks

Implemented a neural network model that can implement a generic architecture of a simple network. Allowed the number of layers, the number of hidden units in each layer, and the activations in each layer to be hyperparameters that can be changed easily. Experimented with different architectures and different activations for a classification task. Used SGD for traning and implemented adaptive learning rate decay for better convergence.
